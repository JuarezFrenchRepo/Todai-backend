Here are the current user endpoints for the back-end.  Values and projects will be similar, I'll post those soon. This API allows you to view, post, edit and delete users, values, projects and their associated actions.

WHAT CHANGED:

* added the base url
* changed the endpoints to  /auth/user for user ops.
 
 
Base URL : https://todai-backend.herokuapp.com/
 
# Authentication
Access to protected routes will require login with username and password. A json token will be issued upon login. The tokens are limited to 4 hour session.
