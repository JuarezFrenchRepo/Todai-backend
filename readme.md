Here are the current user endpoints for the back-end.  Values and projects will be similar, I'll post those soon. This API allows you to view, post, edit and delete users, values, projects and their associated actions.

## WHAT CHANGED:
* Users - changed the "GET by username" shape and added "GET by ID"
* Values - now has boolean true/false "select" and 'Top 3" fields. Default for both is "false". Updated the Values table to display the shortened value names.
* Added endpoints for Values  endpoint:  `/api/values`
* The GETs for all resources (users, projects, values) now return all available fields so that you can see what fields are avaiable.
